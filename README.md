# Churn-Analysis-with-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning
This project analyzes churned user behavior, provides actionable recommendations to reduce churn, builds a fine-tuned machine learning model for churn prediction, and segments users into groups based on behavior. Insights are used to design targeted promotions for each group.
# Introduction
Customer churn poses significant challenges for businesses, impacting not only revenue but also long-term growth and customer acquisition costs. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn analysis a crucial aspect of business strategy. Churned users, those who discontinue their association with the company, can reveal critical insights into service gaps, customer dissatisfaction, or competitive pressures. By understanding the patterns and behaviors of these customers, businesses can proactively address underlying issues, refine their offerings, and implement strategies that enhance customer loyalty.

Analyzing churned users is not just about reducing attrition; it also opens up opportunities to increase customer lifetime value and improve brand reputation. Effective churn management can lead to personalized interventions, targeted promotions, and improved customer satisfaction, ultimately driving better business outcomes.

The dataset used for this analysis includes variables such as customer demographics, purchase history, satisfaction scores, and activity levels. Key features like Churn status, Tenure, PreferredPaymentMethod, and SatisfactionScore provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior and preferences, forming the basis for detailed segmentation and predictive modeling.
# Objectives
- *Analyze the patterns and behavior of churned users:* Identify the factors and behaviors common among churned customers and suggest strategies to reduce churn.

- *Build a Machine Learning model for predicting churned users:* Develop and fine-tune a predictive model to forecast customer churn based on the available data.

- *Segment churned users based on behavior:* Group churned users by their behaviors and characteristics, highlighting differences between these groups, to inform targeted retention strategies and promotional offers.
